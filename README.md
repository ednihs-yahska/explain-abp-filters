## Description
This project is created mostly by AI prompts in an effort to understand the advantages and challenges of using prompts for AI for software development.
The code was developed using OpenAi's o4-mini reasoning model.
This page mainly looks at some Adblock Plus filters and uses Anthropic's Claude 3.7 model API to explain the ABP filter in plain english.

## 2 Major takeaways or first impressions.
### Good
Programming/Coding seems to be easy for AI, but in small doses. Developers still need to plan the approach and execute the plan in steps (atleast for now)

### Bad
Sometimes the code output lacked consistency, minor mistakes can go under the radar because 95% of output code just works.
